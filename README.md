# Practice.DesignPatterns

This is my practice playground for .NET design patterns developed with the help of C# language and Visual Studio 2015 Development Environment. All patterns demonstrated in this repository were referenced from [DotFactory](https://www.dofactory.com)

Each pattern is implemented as a class library and tested by a corresponding console application or unit test. All projects have the same assembly name pattern, i.e. DP.&lt;PatternName> , DP.&lt;PatternName>.<ConsoleApp/UnitTest>
